You can source parts kits from a couple places:

Gunbroker.com has them occasionally; you can win auctions for under $200.  Search using keywords: "Tec 9", "Tec-9", "Tec9", "AB 10", "AB-10", "AB10" (their search function sucks, so you will probably need to use each keyword).

Everygunpart.com has Tec-9/AB-10 parts listed most of the time. The kit is $300 but no auctions.  Search "Tec 9" on their site and you will find them. The the AB 10s (AB10 and Tec 9 are the same gun, AB10 [After Ban 10] is just a 94 AWB compliant version).

##### Modifications to the ejector are needed:
1. Print the modification jig.
2. Place the ejector into the jig.
3. Drill a 1/8" holes following the jigs hole location.
4. Cut following the jigs cut lines, two cuts are needed.
5. Clean up any sharp edges.

##### Fitment:
1. Filing maybe needed to the receiver where the upper sits behind the trigger group to get the upper to fit properly. Due to printing some round surfaces get printed flat and they need to be filled back into a round surface. 
2. Different height mag catches are included in order to help you fit the mag properly. You want the mag as close to the bolt as possible but without the magazine making contact with the bolt.
3. To fit the ejector to the frame you may need to use small 1/16" files to open up the slot the ejector goes into. 
4. All holes will need to be reamed out with drill bits. 

##### Additional Info:
1. A brace adapter is provided but no brace is included.
