#### Description
Here we have a generation 3 Glock 17 frame by BadJob. it has the slide rails on the frame. This frame was designed to work with 22lr and will likely not stand up to 9mm or larger calibers. 

This design is dimensionally accurate however we do not recommend it for 3dprinted use. Further efforts are being made to reinforce this design.
