#### Description 
This is the (Glock) G18 Extendez 30 Round Magazine by Ivanthetroll. This magazine is 3D-printable and includes the G18 body, follower, floorplate and locking tab. 

This project represents over 500 hours of time in CAD, over 250 hours of 3D printer running time, over 1000 rounds of ammo, all over the course of six months - plus a few more hours and 100 more rounds to develop the Extendez :). The end result is worth it - a 3D printable Glock magazine that cost next to nothing to print, will last several hundred rounds, can be printed on essentially any FDM/FFF printer, and requires little to no post-processing.

Below are instructions on printing and troubleshooting the Menendez Mag series.

#### What you'll need:

* PLA (Optionally Nylon [645 is tested good], PETG).  I recommend PLA, as it is cheap, easy to print, and is what I designed the mag in.
* A printer capable of printing PLA (or the plastic you choose to use).  The Creality Ender 3 is capable of printing these magazines, and costs only 200 bucks. A guide to dialing in your printer can be found [here:](https://jstark1809.keybase.pub/DetDisp_3D_Printing_Guide.pdf?dl=1).
* An appropriate Glock magazine spring - use factory-spec Glock mag springs (not PMAG springs).  These can be had cheap from Amazon, The Official Glock Store (NOT Glockstore.com!!!), Wilson Combat, AliExpress (the springs usually come with a baseplate extension).
		
#### Print Settings

##### Orientations
Note that the included STLs are scaled and oriented correctly!
	 
* Print magazine body upright, no supports.
* Print baseplate bottom down, no supports.
* Print locking tab bottom down, no supports.
* Print follower upside down, with the tallest flat portion to the print bed.  Use supports from print bed, but not full supports.
	
##### Print Setup
I recommend that you print in eSun PLA+, don't get too upset when you print it in ABS and it works poorly.
		 
* Nozzle Temp             - 230C
* Bed Temp                - 60C
* Brim                    - ON
* Supports                - NONE
* Layer Height            - 0.15mm
* Shells (aka perimeters) - 4 inner/outer (this may not be necessary, but works well for me)
* Bed prep                - Gluestick, optionally on top of Kapton Tape.
	
#### Troubleshooting 
* Magazines may feed poorly at first.  This is because the mag lips are reinforced beyond what PMAGs or Factory mags are.  
* Dry cycle (or live fire) a full magazine through it if it has issues feeding.  This will solve rough feeding issues. 
* Printed magazines will wear out.  Their rate of wear depends entirely on the user.  
* If you feed rounds into the mag in a manner that drags the round along the mag lips, you will cause excess wear on the mag lips, which will wear the magazine out.
* Testing has netted a magazine that is good for at least 500.  Make sure to load each mag carefully as to not scrape the rounds along the mag lips when loading.
