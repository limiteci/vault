This is the VZ-61 Lower Receiver by FreemenDontAsk. It uses a standard VZ-61 Parts Kit and a semiautomatic selector. If you have a full auto selector you will need to drill out the safety hole and modify the selector so that it will work (without the selector this gun works semiauto only, so you can just leave the selector out if you wish).

#### Parts Required 
* Standard VZ-61 Parts Kit

#### Printing
* Print at 99% infill with support.

#### Assembly
After printing you will need to ream out all holes and you will need to connect the small hole by the safety selector hole with the safety selector hole. Install the rear trigger assembly by inserting into the frame then put the trigger in a vice and move the receiver to get the trigger into place then install the trigger guard and then you can install the hammer and hammer spring.
