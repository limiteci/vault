#### Description
Inspired by the shuty by shadowfall. 

Thanks for the original shuty design. Although I have made many changes, Every piece still bears the original design. I am going to finish updating the design today and get it to you very soon. My goal was to keep it as simple as possible. The bolt is just three steel dowels stacked on top of each other. They have to be a specific diameter and welded together parallel. The center dowel is just a spacer. I used a lone wolf barrel and a regular AR hammer. All of the screws and springs are from the hardware store. It still needs a deflector even though it manages to eject the spent rounds most of the time. The bolt could stand to be lightened a little and the bottom rails of the plastic bolt need the insides trimmed a little so that the magazine can have thicker side walls. The mag spring is from a Chinese military 9mm. Hopefully you can improve on this. My cad skills are limited to freecad and it crashes a lot. Feel free to relay this info.


#### Hardware

##### Spring
1. Buffer spring - 3 1/4 x 13/16 x .062    x2  Ace hardware. these springs need to be the correct ones. no sustitutes. stock length no cutting.
2. Bumper spring is a 13/16 spring very stiff. I wrap a little tape around one end so that it fits snug into the buffer bolt. The length should be cut so that the bolt bumps it after the hammer is cocked.
3. Ejector spring - 7/32 x .032   this spring is really a bit too stiff but works. cut this spring just long enough so that when the ejector is fully extended, the spring is almost full extended too. might try a slightly weaker spring if you can find one.
4. firing pin spring. 7/32 x .015.  cut it short enough so that the pin can fully move forward (hammer flush against the back of bolt) before the spring bottoms out.
