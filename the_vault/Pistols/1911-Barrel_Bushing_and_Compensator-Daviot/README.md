# 1911 Barrel Bushing+Compensator

#### Author
Daviot (Alex Putnam)

#### Version
1.0

#### Description
A milspec/standard barrel bushing for the M1911A1 pistol, with an extended bushing sleeve (1.25") with three compensator slots, reverse-engineered from a stainless steel example.  Fit tested in a Para 14.45.

Ever since seeing the 3d printed bushing wrench, I thought it needed a 3d printed -bushing to go with it.  Similar designs existed, but were geared towards Airsoft replicas and were .stl meshes with no originating models.

#### Printing
Due to high impact stresses, if making a functional part, use 100% infill with a durable plastic (ABS, nylon, PETG/polyester).
