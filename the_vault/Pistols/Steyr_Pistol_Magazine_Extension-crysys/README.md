# Steyr Pistol Magazine Extension

#### Author

#### Version 
2.5

#### Description
A replacement bottom cap for Steyr 9mm pistol magazines. This one adds three rounds to the 17 round factory magazine, or 5 rounds if you have the older 15 round magazine though it is not tested. The components are front and back magazine cap pieces and a new spring plate. The spring plate is thin and should be reinforced with a small piece of sheet metal cut to fit underneath it. Larger sizes may be added if they are tested and found to function.

Print these three pieces, front and back cap faces down and spring plate on back end. Trim front and back pieces until they fit, glue together.  Cut a small piece of sheet metal in shape of the bottom of spring plate, ensure it fits in bottom of cap.  Reassemble magazine with new parts.

The cap pieces are designed to be easy to make on most printers. The spring plate is delicate and can be a challenging print, use plenty of support. I recommend ABS, PLA is likely too brittle and is untested.
