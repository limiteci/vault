#### Description

This is a MK II ("Mark Two") receiver. This is not meant to be printed but rather machined. All units are in inches. Please forgive me for the messy drawings. A dovetail for the rear sight has not been included in the model. Not much else to it, just remember the 3 rules of shooting. I guess if you use it or modify it, give credit or just yell at me in FOSSCAD.

Disclaimer: Build at your own risk.

#### Construction Note
* SEAMLESS steel tube that is 1" OD x 0.75" ID
* The threads for the barrel are 13/16x20
