#### Description

Recoil spring isn’t realistic since I referred this part to an airsoft replica.

The sight is based upon Speedsights, http://speedsights.com/ . Because I think it’s quite fancy back then(they changed dots from triangular to square in present. I still prefer prior though.), and I reeeeaaaaly like G34 so much.

And because I wanted to make the serial exchangeable, so I made a serial plate and a fixer for it. Which you shouldn’t expect on a real steel. And the groove, located above firing pin channel like G18 having, is a feature I used to check its depth. Normally a G34/G35 will not have it. Also, few minor features, like 2 weight-loss grooves located in the inner side of slide, had not been constructed. FYI

This is a “photo” and “explode diagram” based model. Althought I did my best to get close to real things, but errors shouldn’t be avoidable. Please don’t expect too much accuracy except 9mm cartridges which is based on drawings on wikipedia. Created around 3 yrs ago (end of 2009) using pro-e while was studying.
