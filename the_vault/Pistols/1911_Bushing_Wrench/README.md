# 1911 Bushing Wrench 

#### Description
This is a weird barrel bushing wrench me and a friend at work developed over the course of a few weeks. The design came out of the fact that he said that with the traditional styled wrench there was a danger of the spring loaded guide tube flying out and possibly hitting you in the face. So he asked why I couldnâ€™t make him a round one. This is what we ended up with. You grip it with your palm, thus your hand is always over the spring. It works like a charm. Tell me what you guys think.
