# HOLE PUNCH GUN 

#### Description
The pieces of plastic in the video in no way make up a firearm. This is a desktop toy, and is a single hole punch that can punch through 2 sheets of paper at a time. Think of this design as an elaborate hole punch.

The current model weights in at 50.1 grams and costs roughly $0.75 to make.

This printed model pictured is the third version of the hole punch. It is composed of 5 pins, the bolt, the receiver, the trigger and sear.

This project is not yet completed. The bolt head is not long enough to punch paper, and the rubber band should not be wrapped around the gun, instead attached somewhere near the muzzle.
