# Skorpion VZ-61

#### Author

#### Version
6.0

#### Description
This is the VZ-61 Version 6 by Daviot. This version is a modification of brute's vz61 receiver that requires less tooling.

#### Changelog
Update 2/21/2017-Added threads to the lower receiver to allow the grip screw to thread into the printed receiver as on the metal versions, as finding a tap for ISO M15x1 RH threads is a pain. Also included is a printable M15x1 RH nut to testfit if your printer can print adequate threads.-Daviot

#### Build notes (Daviot)
* This new v6 includes printed threads for the grip screw. If you would rather cut said threads yourself, use the the v5 model and use a high-speed steel tap.
* If printing in ABS, the magazine well will require sanding and test fitting due to shrinkage.
* If building a semi-auto Vz-61 from a military parts kit, you will need either a semi-auto sear or to cut the interruptor prong off the sear and a semi-auto selector switch.
