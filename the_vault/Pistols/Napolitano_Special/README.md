# NAPOLITANO SPECIAL 

#### Description

INTRODUCING HOMELAND SECURITIZER’S “The Napolitano Special” which is a removable barrel speed-reloadable pistol system designed to be printed and assembled with easily-accessible parts.

This one’s for you Dianne!

This is the barrel concept to a removable barrel setup thought up by me. I lack 3D printing capability so I cannot test this. I understand 3D printers can’t start printing in mid air, but I’m banking on the printers being able to slowly walk over an edge layer by layer to give an inclination. Some tweaking may apply. Holes are for .22-LR. Grip part of hand-gun not made yet, but is to have a taser-like stepup setup with 9V battery and 6 pairs of +/- pins for the backs of the .22-LRs to contact when a reload barrel (single use btw) is slid on. Grip portion is to have a clip over the top to ‘click’ in. Homeland Securitizer releases this under the GNU GPL, version 3.

Grip concept to come. If anyone wants specifics, or my consultation in modification, contact me at hlsecuritizer@tormail.org
