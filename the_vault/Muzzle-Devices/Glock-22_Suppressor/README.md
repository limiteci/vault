# GLOCK-22 SUPPRESSOR 

#### Description

Sorry there is no core (proprietary) but the body and end caps are included. This is for a 40S&W weapon with a 9/16-24 threaded barrel. Make your own core and enjoy. (If you decide to manufacture such devices it is up to you to do all appropriate paperwork. I accept no responsibility for what users may do with this.)
