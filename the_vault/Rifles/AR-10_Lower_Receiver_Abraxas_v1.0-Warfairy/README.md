#### Description

This is meant to be an easy to print version of an AR-10 lower receiver. The magazine well has been deepened down until it meets the bottom most plane to allow for the largest and most stable contact patch posible with as little support material as possible. Support material will still need to be turned on, however, as the rear half of the receiver does not have any support and sports very large overhangs.

This is an AR-10 receiver, but as it has no bolt hold open, any AR-15 lower parts kit can be used. Ensure your buffer and buffer tube are rated for AR-10 use prior to firing. AR-15 uppers will NOT fit this receiver.

#### Printing

Print as it stands with support material on, 100% infill, and cold acetone treat after printing to ensure strongest possible part.

#### Notes
Credit to LTS for inspiration on the base receiver, JT and Shadowfall for the buffer tower reinforcement.
