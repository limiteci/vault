#### Description 

This design is intially inspired from the vanguard by Shadowfall. Special thanks to JT for improvements and testing. So what happens when you take most of the magazine well away from an AR-15? Turns out, not a bloody thing. It feeds and functions flawlessly, with the magazine being perfectly stable even when beat on. With the almost FAL look to the magazine well, its sexy, light, and most importantly, has been tested past 2000 rounds with a standard 5.56 upper. It has been tested with Magpul PMAG's and Aluminium GI mags without failure. Magazines drop free.

#### Printing Instructions 

Print Phobos_V1.2.STL if printer is capable of the size. Print vertically for greatest strength. Print side to side only if Z axis incapable of sufficient height. Acetone treatment after printing recommended after vertical printing, required after side to side printing. Phobos_V1.2_Front.STL should be printed Vertically, Phobos_V1.2_Rear.STL should be printed back to front. Acetone welding will be required to bond the two parts, and acetone treatment will be required post-welding to ensure adequate strength.
