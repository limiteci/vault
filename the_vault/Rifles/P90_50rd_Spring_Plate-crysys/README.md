#### Description
One of the advantages of the P90 and the 5.7x28 round is the large capacity the weapon is capable of carrying in a small package. In some markets the standard 50 round magazine is limited to 30 rounds or less. These 30rd magazines are identical to the 50 round version with the exception of the spring plate being extended to block the magazine. The 30 round magazine is also sometimes cheaper or more easily found, even in markets where the 50 round magazine is legal. This is the smaller spring plate found in the 50 round magazine so that you may convert the smaller capacity mags.  

Print these two pieces and glue them bottom to bottom.

These files are designed to be easy to make on most printers  IT should work equally well in PLA, ABS, or nearly any other non-flexible filament.
