# Vanguard_JT AR-15 Receiver 

#### Author

#### Version 
1.1

#### Description 
The Vanguard_JT is an AR15 lower receiver designed to withstand as many rounds as possible. The Vanguard_JT was modeled from the Vanguard by shadowfall. 

*The 45 degree cut of the magwell was originally designed so that the lower could be printed at a 45 degree angle to eliminate the need for support material. Printing at a 45 degree angle is not recommended. It was found that printing the lower at a 45 degree angle will lead to the buffer tube tower breaking in only a few shots. The 45 degree cut in the magwell was kept because it allowed for magazines to be inserted more efficiently. 
*The buffer tube tower was thickened and lengthened to increase durability. The castle nut and buttstock tube lock are not needed on the Vanguard_JT because of its lengthened buffer tube tower.
*The front take-down pinhole was widened to improve durability. 

Note: The Vanguard JT went to version 1.1 with the inclusion of an updated version by FP.  The updates are enumerated in the changelog v1.1 section of this readme file.  For now both versions are included while we test.

#### Instructions 
*Print at a horizontal orientation as seen in renders
*Depending on quality of print, screwing the buffer tube into the buffer tube tower may be difficult. Applying heat to the buffer tube from the inside with a miniature blow torch or equivalent eases screwing in the buffer tube.
*Depending on quality of print, it is likely that all holes will need to be drilled out to the correct size
*For assembly, Snap Pins (included with files) or  1/4-20 machine screws with wing nuts are recommended. Since the front take-down pin hole is wider than the rear, there are two Snap Pin files included, a Front Snap Pin and a Rear Snap Pin. Under rapid-fire conditions, the Snap Pins WILL BREAK after around 200 rounds. If using Snap Pins, have extras ready to replace broken Snap Pins. 

#### Changelog v1.1

*Moved the front takedown pin and safety detent holes (by FP).
