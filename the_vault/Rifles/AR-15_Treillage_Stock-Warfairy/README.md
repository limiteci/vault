#### Description

The Treillage AR-15 Competition Stock is meant to bring a low cost option to NRA High Power competition and 3-Gun for fully adjustable stocks. The milled ones I've seen go for 180 USD or more. What it does is give you a fully adjustable stock, including length of pull, camber, and cast. The clamp around the tube allows the user to move the stock arm 360 degrees around the buffer tube, the clamp around the stock arm allows the user to adjust the length of pull and angle of the rear plate, and finally, the rear plate is adjusted using a threaded rod to move the rear plate up and down in relation to the stock arm. You can now truly make your rifle fit your body with around 15 USD worth of materials.

#### Required parts

* 8x M3 16mm Socket Head Cap Screw (McMaster part number 95263A158)
* 8x Type 316 Stainless Steel Belleville Spring Lock Washer (McMaster part number 93237A102)
* 8x Zinc Yellow-Chromate Plated Steel Hex Nut (McMaster part number 92497A200)

#### Printing

All of the individual parts should be relatively easy prints. Ensure your support is on as there are overhangs on most of the parts.

#### Assembly

1. Place Rear_Adjust into slot of Arm. The threaded section should sit inside the channel of the Arm.

2. Place Rear_Plate onto Arm assembly and thread Rear_Adjust into threaded tab of Rear_Plate, drawing it down until the top and bottom surfaces of Arm and Rear_Plate are approximately level.

3. Place Base_2 onto the underside of your Carbine Buffer Tube, making sure that the peg rests in the rear most adjustment hole of the Buffer Tube Rail. Now Place Base_1 onto the top of the buffer tube such that the grooves in the Base align.

4. Place Clamp_2 over the Base ring, ensuring smooth mating of the ridges with the grooves. Do the same with Clamp_1. Secure losely by placing nuts into appropriate slots in Clamp_1, and threading 16mm M3 screws and washers to clamp in place.

5. Install Clamp_3 onto buffer tube assembly using same method as Clamp_1 and 2. Leave loose. Slide Arm Assembly into the clamp and lightly tighten Clamp assmebly onto the Arm.

6. Adjust stock as desired. When optimum position is attained, tighten down all 8 M3 screws to lock in place. Rear_Plate may be adjusted using a coin or large screw driver. Installation is complete.
