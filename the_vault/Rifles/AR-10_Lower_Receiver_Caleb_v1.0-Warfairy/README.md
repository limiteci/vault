# Caleb AR-10 Receiver

#### Version 
1.0

#### Description
This is an AR-10 receiver. It will not work with AR-15 uppers. It is DPMS pattern. Bolt hold open has been deleted on this lower receiver, so any AR-15 lower parts kit can be used to build it out. Ensure any parts kit installed has been rated for AR-10 use.

#### Printing

Highly recommended to print as a single part due to the increased forces involved with the AR-10. Cold Acetone treatment is highly recommended post-printing to get the most solid part possible.

#### Notes

For any complaints, recommendations, praise and death threats, please contact WarFairy on the #fosscad IRC on irc.oftc.net, or join us at www.fosscad.org/fc/chat

#### Credits
