#AR-15 Uzi Style AR15 9mm Magazine

####Description
This will fit a AR15 that is setup to work with the 9mm.It will also work with a vanilla AR that has a magwell adapter like the Spikes Tactical Enhanced 9mm MagWell Block (e.g. http://stores.9mmar.com/-strse-36/Spikes-Tactical-Enhanced-9mm/Detail.bok)


The mag_body_AR.STEP, is specially fit to work with the AR magwell adapter, as the body in Uzi_30rd_Magzine_v0.2_nils will not.  With mag_body_AR.STEP you can use the other parts in the Uzi_30rd_Magzine_v0.2_nils/ folder to complete the mag. 

Notes:  the mag fits the magwell perfectly (nils) but the issue is that the magwell adapter is 1mm in some parts.  One solution I see is to make the magwell adapter part of the lower v5 or v5.1 (or any other lower, i.e., the shuty or charon models).
