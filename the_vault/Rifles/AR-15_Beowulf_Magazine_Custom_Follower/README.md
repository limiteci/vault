# BEOWULF MAG FOLLOWER â€“ ALEXANDER ARMS CUSTOM 

#### Description

A custom Alexander Arms Beowulf mag follower. Since they just give you a crappy 5.56mm follower instead of one designed for the .50 Beowulf round, I decided to make my own. Slight modifications might be required. I used a file to sand down the front peg to allow the round to clear the top of the magazine. I also pulled out the lips of the magazine a bit, but that is normally required to convert a 5.56mm mag to a beowulf mag. I have included the solidworks file as well, so it can be easily modified. I printed mine using a solidoodle 3 with the follower facing upright and using honeycomb support structures. Enjoy!
