# Aliamanu-Phobos AR-15 Lower Receiver

#### Author

#### Version
1.0

#### Description
The Aliamanu-Phobos AR-15 lower receiver design is inspired by the Phobos AR-15 lower receiver by Warfairy, the Vanguard JT AR-15 lower receiver by JT and the Vanguard AR-15 lower receiver by Shadowfall.

An Ambidextrous safety cutout was added at the suggestion of Crysys. A bolt catch assembly from Vanguard JT receiver was also kept while integrating a reinforced Phobos style mag well.

**Note:** The lower in the renders is a right-hand safety selector cutout version. All other features are the same.

#### Instructions and Notes

Designs referenced in this project have been tested after printing on XYZPrinting Da Vinci 1.0.

* Test printed with 0.2mm layer height. 
* Supports turned on. Solid in-fill. 
* Lower should be built from trigger guard up, top of mag well parallel to printing bed. 
* Keep printer in enclosed environment to minimize temperature fluctuation and ABS shrinkage. 
* Long support material parallel to the lower's length is HIGHLY prone to warping and not recommended.
* **FOR GLASS HEATED BED:** If adhesion of supports to bed fails, try applying 3M Scotch masking tape firmly to bed.
Apply stick glue (decent) or dissolved ABS acetone slurry (best but toxic) onto masking tape surface after application.
* Final sanding of fire control group cavity to fit may be necessary due to shrinking.


#### Author's Notes
For the preservation and perpetuation of the 2nd amendment of the US Constitution and self defense rights for people around the world.

Special thanks to JT, WarFairy, Shadowfall, Crysys, Duces and the support of others in FOSSCAD community.

Feel free to update, modify and redesign this lower as you see fit. Includes ambidextrous and right-hand safety cutout versions.

Come and make it!
