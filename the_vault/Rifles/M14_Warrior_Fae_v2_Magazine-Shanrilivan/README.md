# WarFairy Arms M14 Magazine

#### Description 
Its a M14 magazine, not a whole lot to say about it.

#### Instructions
* You will need sandpaper or steel wool for surface finishing. 
* Print all magazine bodies from back to front, support material on. When cleaning support structures away, pay special attention to the inside surface of the feed lips to ensure smooth dispensing of ammunition. 
* For restricted capacity magazines, you will need the follower with the mag block cut.
* All magazines use the same base plate and require an M14 magazine spring.
* Bolt hold open does NOT work with any of these magazines.

As always, follow local laws when printing magazines.
