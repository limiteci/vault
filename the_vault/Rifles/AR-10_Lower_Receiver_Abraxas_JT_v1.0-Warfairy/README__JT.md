# Abraxas JT AR-10 Receiver 

#### Version 
1.0

#### Description
This is meant to be an easy to print version of an AR-10 lower receiver. It uses the magazine well pioneered by JT on his variation of the Vanguard to allow for less intense support material use while still having a good, large contact patch and maximizes the space available in the print envelope.

This is an AR-10 receiver, but as it has no bolt hold open, any AR-15 lower parts kit can be used. Ensure your buffer and buffer tube are rated for AR-10 use prior to firing. AR-15 uppers will NOT fit this receiver.

#### Printing
Print as it stands with support material on, 100% infill, and cold acetone treat after printing to ensure strongest possible part.

####Notes
Credit to LTS for inspiration on the base receiver, JT and Shadowfall for the buffer tower reinforcement, and JT for the Magazine well concept.
