# WarFairy Hermes Zero AR-15 Lower Receiver

#### Version
2.0

#### Description

The ultra light version of the ultra light lower. Coming in at 136.5 grams (0.3 lbs), it is, without a doubt, the lightest lower currently printable.

This file is recommended only for ADVANCED firearm printers. This has the thinnest safety margin of any of my designs, and should be treated as such until its integrity can be verified.

Files are NOT sectioned for small printers. This needs to be printed in a single piece due to the thinner walls. I HIGHLY recommend printing bottom to top and cold acetone treatment after printing.

For bug reporting, please notify me on IRC via the #fosscad channel on irc.oftc.net. You can also access the IRC channel via the fosscad.org page, using the chat link at the top of the page.

Be safe and happy hunting.

#### Changelog for v2.0 

* Replace buffer tower with modified JT Buffer tower for reinforcement. 
* Reinforcement added to top of magwell behind takedown pins.
* Reinforcement between forward takedown lugs.
