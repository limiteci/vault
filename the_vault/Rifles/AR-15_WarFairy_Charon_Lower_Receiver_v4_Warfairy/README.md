v4.0

#### Description
This is the Charon AR-15 Modular Lower Receiver System version 4.0. This glorious design has take over two years in the making. It is a modular single piece AR receiver requiring a LPK and Upper for a fully functioning do it yourself rifle...woo hoo!

#### Changelog:
* Changed forward takedown lugs to use 1/4" bolts rather than AR takedown pins
* Relief cut on grips to allow easier access to safety.
* Relief cut on upright grip for middle finger to rest more comfortably.
* Centering of Buffer Tube opening and slight enlargement for greater reliability and margin of safety.
* All parts oriented for printing.
* Removal of Bolt Hold Open for strength.

#### General instructions:
This release has been totally modularized. To create a firearm, you will need to select Magwell_3a, 3b, or 3c, Buffer_Tube_1 or 2, Grip_1 or 2, and finally the Stock of your choice. The Unbuffered Pistol and Vanilla receiver are located in the Stocks folder and only have the options of Magwell_3a, 3b, or 3C.

If printing the Carbine, Rifle, or Kommando, all Auxiliary parts are located in the Extra Parts folder.

There is a hollow on the right side of the magazine well for use with the panels in the Magazine Well folder. A blank panel is included for you to modify to your own taste or to fill the indent if you don't want a logo or to personalize. This area will also allow any manufacturers to easily make a serialized insert.

You will need to print 8 parts for each firearm receiver, with the logo panel being the ninth, (Excluding the Vanilla Receiver (5 parts) and Unbuffered Pistol (6 parts)) consisting of: Magwell (3 parts), Grip, Buffer Tube (2 Parts), Stock (2 parts). If you use Magwell 3C, you do not need the other two Magwell parts.

#### Printing Instructions:
All parts are oriented for direct printing. I leave print options up to you and your individual printer, but I highly reccommend printing at the lowest possible layer height, and I insist you use 100% infill for your own safety. Try not to use support material for Magwell_1 and 2 or for either Grip section. Slic3r has a nasty habit of filling in essential holes. I HIGHLY recommend Cura as a slicing program. Not only does it allow you to position multiple items on the bed at once, its gcode generation and support material are FAR more forgiving than Slic3r.

#### Assembly Instructions:
The guide nubs and divots on each part should steer you in the right direction as far as location. I highly recommend using a proper ABS Cement and allowing at least 24 hours after gluing before test firing. Ensure the Fire control pocket and buffer tubes are clear of any support material or significant deviations before assembly. Assemble 3 parts of Magwell first. Ensure bolt release slot and magazine release tube are well formed and free of obstruction. Apply grip to magwell. Assemble Stock Sections. Apply Stock to grip. Place buffer tube sections into respective areas on upper flat of stock and grip. Allow glue to set before test fire.

*Warnings: * THESE FILES ARE UNTESTED. PRINT AND FIRE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

#### Author's note:
In this day and age, this project and these releases are more important to me than I can tell you. I reserve no rights to these files. They are now yours. Chop them, hack them, twist them, make them yours. Only you can make exactly the firearm you want, and I've now given you a modular system to make it that much easier.

Be safe, have fun.

You are Free Men,
act like it!
