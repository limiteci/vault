# 10rd AK Magazine

### Description 

A 10rd AK mags based on the DD Feinstein mag design. Improvements made to the design to strengthen the feed lips and base plate. Failures occurred in these areas during dev and testing of the mag when the magazine was over loaded/pressurized. Though this shouldn't occur with normal use I thought they could use some reinforcement. The modifications increased rigidity and durability of the magazine. The mags pictured below worked great in my M10-762 model AK.

All parts should be printed at 100% infill and in an upright orientation. The magazine body and base plate may be printed without support material, but I would recommend using support material for both the spring base and the follower. I use support spacing at 10mm for an easier cleanup. The follower will need the sides lightly sanded so that it slides freely. The spring base may need light sanding on the edges so that it moves freely enough to mate with the base plate. Magazines pictured here were printed using ABS at a .3mm layer height on an SD3. Spring used was 1/2 a Wolff 30rd per magazine. I don't have a force gauge so this was just a guesstimate and performed well.

Over all I am very pleased with this design and will use these mags in place of 30 rounders now banned by King Cuomo. Total cost per mag is apx $4 including 2900cm filament and half a Wolff spring. Enjoy!


### Improvements made
* Reduced 'bolt window' from 10mm to 7mm
* Removed rounded corners of 'bolt window'
* Increased thickness of top/back of the mag by 1mm and removed tapering
* Added small lip on front base to better secure base plate
* Reduced length of follower to fit 10rd. Original Feinstein follower will fit 8rd in this mag
* Increased length of spring base to eliminate play in mag base
* Redesigned mag base to contour magazine and lock in front lip
