#### Description

This is the Anderson Firearms Ghostfire AR-15 Lower Receiver by PotatoSociety. This is a WILD design that took some real thinking to make. This lower receiver is modular like the Bolt Lower Receiver by RollaTroll but the similarities really stop there. This is a whole new way of looking at the a modular AR-15 lower receiver. ENJOY!

#### Required Parts

* AR-15 Lower Parts kit
* Complete AR-15 Upper Receiver
* A Machine Screw Kit, Round Head Combo Drive (the instructions pdf has the exact contents needed)

#### Printing Instructions

Everything needs to be printed with 100% infill, preferabally in ABS but was designed to also survive being printed in PLA. See pdf instructions to refer to the testing section regarding performances of PLA lower.

#### Author Notes
There is a support strut directly above the fire selector. It won't block the safety, but it will make it harder to manipulate at times and possibly while speed shooting.

The magazine tightly fits into the magazine well. This is intentional, and allows the bolt catch to snag the magazine follower.

This design works and has been tested with 150rnds of .223 55g monarch. I am not responsible for personal injury or death, the design was fired to ensure that it actually works. Use at your own risk.

Future updates will aim towards making a lower that is acceptable for competition use. I will try and train with this lower to the point of reloading under three seconds and will compete with it. I want to prove that the future of technology is here and that people should come to terms that nothing will ever stop the flow of firearms to the general public.
