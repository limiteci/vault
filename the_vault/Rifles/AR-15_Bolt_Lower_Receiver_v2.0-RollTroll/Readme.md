# Bolt AR-15 Lower Reciever

#### Author 
RollaTroll

#### Version
2.0

#### Description 

The Gauntlet has been thrown down and the 3dprinting faculty, FOSSCAD, has answered with this lower receiver you don't need to 3dprint but you TOTALLY CAN :D!

Provided are 2 sets of files, denoted by 'Original' or 'Reinforced'. The Original parts in this folder can be used to mill or cut out a lower receiver and should NOT be used to make a 3dprinted lower receiver. 

AGAIN, ORIGINAL FILES ARE NOT MEANT TO BE PRINTED.

The Reinforced parts were designed for printing. Original and Reinforced parts do not mix.

Also provided are DWG files which are popular with laster cutting. The left and right sides should be fully cuttable while other files have been provided for reference. ALL Bolt files should be used at the operators discretion and own risk.

##### Community Updates 
Warfairy has added some alternative magazine side plates to give your bolt a FOSSCAD Phobos or Vanguard JT lower receivers appearence. He has also included middle side plates and a buffer tower that eliminate the safety. Besides simplicity, this safety free option allows for another bolt to be added to the buffer tower, see Renders for pictures.  All of these files are named with 'Warfairy'.

#### Instructions:
All hardware M3 sized.
* Nut x15
* 10mm x6
* 30mm X5
* 25mm X2
* 50mm X2

Print/make 1 of all:

* Buffer tower should be printed flat, perpendicular to the print bed, as if the stock were vertical,
* Grip part should be printed on its side.
* Mag well front should be printed with the pivot holes away from the print bed so that the interior face that is profiled for the mag well is against the print bed.
* Mag well back should be printed with the largest falt side against the print bed. This is the side opposite the mag well.
* Both mag well sides should be printed on their largest flat face, the side opposite the mag well.
* Both left and right (rear) sides should be printed with the internal facing (flattest) sides against the print bed.
* Fire control well bottom should be printed flat, so the side facing the trigger guard is against the print bed.
* Trigger guard can be printed either flat (so it looks like a bridge), or on its side (so it needs no support).
