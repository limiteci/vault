The module provides a drop in FCG (think p90 trigger module) for FOSSCAD compatible AR platforms. it requires that you use a AR-15 lower parts kits.  You can then assemble said parts into the module and install it into a compatible lower receiver (included in the folder).  The module requires 3mm cross pins to hold in place (see crosspin.stl) which can be printed, however, metal cross pins are recommended.  The pins should be as long as the outside of the receiver. More compatible lowers to come.
