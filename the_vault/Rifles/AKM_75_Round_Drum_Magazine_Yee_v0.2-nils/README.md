### Description
A 75 round drum based off of the classic AKM/RPK drum, dedicated to the gun-grabbing California State Senator Yee. This CAD contains parts inspired by the Defense Distributed Feinstein Magazine.

### Construction
**WARNING** This is an alpha-quality release. A working drum will require significant manual adjustment.
All parts should be printed at 100% infill. 


### Assembly

View the exploded view for reference
1. Place the torsion spring inside the inner circle of the large drum body. The spring's outer key should align with a notch in the center ring of the body. The spring should be inserted into the body in the clockwise orientation.
2. Feed the guide rod through the hole in the front of the drum body, while aligning the small slot with the torsion spring's center loop.
3. Place the torsion spring cap over said spring. It should fit snugly.
4. Place the key spring around the small cylindrical arm of the key, then place the key spring-first into the center hole of the guide rod. The arms of the key slide into the notches of the guide rod.
5. Place the nubs of the follower in the holes of the spindle arm.
6. Align the notch in the center of the spindle with the arms of the key, then push the spindle until the guide rod emerges through.
7. Align the tabs on the rear body shell with the notches on the front body shell and join the two, making sure the winder is properly aligned with the key.

### Operation

The procedure for loading the drum is very similar to that of other drums.

1. Remove the rear cover
2. Push the key down to remove tension on the spindle
3. While holding the key down, rotate the spindle clockwise until the follower prevents further movement
4. Insert ammunition into the available spaces
5. Replace the rear cover, taking care to properly align the winder with the top of the key
6. Turn the winder counter-clockwise until sufficient tension has been achieved


### TODO
* Modular magazine body (e.g. interface with SKS)
* Adapt drum to accept readily-available torque springs
* Adjust for tolerances/reliability
* Adapt for better printability
* Fix follower
* Adjust drum body tabs
