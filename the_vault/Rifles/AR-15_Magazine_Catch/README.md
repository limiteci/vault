# AR15 Magazine Catch

### Description 
This is my first attempt, I am printing it right now, and seeing if it fits :) Also this might not work with all ar15's as I did not make this out of measurements from a working mag catch ( due to not actually owning one ) but instead it was made off of measurements from my 3d printed version ( Printed from one of the versions From this site ), I did however make the openscad file set up so one could very easly change a few of the measurements if needed, hope this helps someone :)
