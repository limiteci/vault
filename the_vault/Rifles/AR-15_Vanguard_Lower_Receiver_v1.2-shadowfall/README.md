#### Version 
1.2

#### Description 
The Vanguard series is designed to minimize support material and add ease of printing to the lower design. #### Instructions Set support settings to .40 (40 degrees). If your printer cannot print 40 degree overhangs a higher number may be chosen, this will increase printing time. An 8" build platform is required for this version. The model should be oriented horizontally as seen in the renders.
