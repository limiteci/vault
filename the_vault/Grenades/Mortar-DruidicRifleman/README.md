#DEFCAD Mortar

#### Descriptions
I see your considering printing out the Defcad Free Open Source Shanny 2 inch mortar round.  This was designed by forum user DruidicRifleman named after a fellow defcader.

#### Warning 
This round was designed to explode on impact. Like any heavy weapon it's dangerous and effectivly a very big Firearm.

Check local laws and range rules etc. If you make this device illegally you may go to prison and enjoy prison man love from an oversized, hairy bubba; this is your problem, not ours. We recomend using wicked AQUA silicone lubricant on your honeymoon to reduce friction with your cell mate  BE CAREFUL if you die we will laugh at you. I am not kidding!

#### Instructions
As of yet you may be one of the first people to fire this mortar. As such, load dummy rounds AND SLOWLY increase the lift charge and walk them out to the desired range. Treat the ABS with MEK or acitone treatment. Note after each round check to see that nothing is left in the tube.

* Future versions will have load data here.

#### Non printed parts you'll need
* 1 reprimed high brass Shotgun shell
* 1 209 primmer (this gets placed at the bottom of the round hole of the primmer plug)
* 1 Turned Metal hammer provided In the Zip pack
* 1 sheet of paper and some tape to Seal the holes in the Base of the mortar round
* 1 a 1.2 inch spring with an ID of .450 inches to retain the fireing pin During handling.

#### NOTE 
Do not attempt to fire LIVE rounds till you have test fired with dummy rounds.  Do not use flash powder or explosives known to be impact sensitive as this could lead to the round going off in the tube.

Enjoy your 2 inch mortar bomb responsibly and do not fire at any thing you don't wanna destroy.
