#### Description
This pistol is designed to be lightweight, small, and easy to print without taking too much time. It currently weighs around 150g
fully assembled without ammunition, excluding the 3.7oz of steel required for the U.S.

#### Assembly
Print out Striker, Trigger, Barrel at 100% infill with no supports. Give the barrel acetone vapor treatment.
Print out Frame_L and Frame_R with supports, flat at 100% infill.
Print out three Pins, 100% infill. 
Obtain a nail of suitable size and a spring for the striker.
Lay Frame_L on side, insert nail into firing pin. Ensure it does not stick out too much. Insert spring
around the guide post on the back of Frame_R. Place striker in Frame_R, ensure it slides correctly and catches on the ridge.
Attach Trigger to Frame_L with one of your Pins. Insert Barrel into slot on Frame_L. Load Barrel at this time. Place Frame_R
over Frame_L (You may want to transfer the striker to Frame_L now that you have tested the spring), and insert the other two
Pins. 

#### To Fire
Pull the lever sticking out of the Striker all the way back and then press down so it catches on the groove. WARNING:
If you release it without pressing down the gun will fire. Ensure that the striker is caught on the ridge before releasing.

When ready to fire, pull the trigger. It will push the striker up above the angled ridge and send it into the firing pin.

#### SAFETY WARNING
DO NOT PULL BACK THE STRIKER/CATCH IT ON THE RIDGE UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO SHOOT. IT IS EXTREMELY EASY TO ACCIDENTALLY FIRE AT 
THIS STAGE, SO DO NOT DO IT UNTIL YOU ARE READY. If you keep the striker up against the firing pin it is safe and will not accidentally fire.

For first test fire, do it remotely by pulling the trigger with a string. This will lower risk of injury.

#### Disclaimer
Follow all local laws. For U.S. residents a non-removable 3.7oz piece of steel must be added. Be aware of your local and federal
laws before assembling. In the state of CA this weapon is illegal as it is a "zipgun". For other states please check your laws.
