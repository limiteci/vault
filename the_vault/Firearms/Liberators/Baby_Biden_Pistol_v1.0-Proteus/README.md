Print the all parts in the folder as well as the following Liberator parts: two triggers, two hammers, two hammer bodies, 6 frame pins, 1 grip pin, 4 hammer springs, 2 trigger springs, 2 firing pins, 2 firing pin bushings.

Assemble as you would a liberator but doubled. Put the barrelpin2 into the hinge connecting the barrel to the frame, and the barrelpin into the hole ontop locking the barrel in place.

It is reccomended that you use a .410 shotshell that uses a slug as opposed to shot in this design.

To operate, swing down the barrel and load two rounds. Close the barrel completely and fit the larger pin into place connecting it to the frame. Fire. 

UNTESTED.
