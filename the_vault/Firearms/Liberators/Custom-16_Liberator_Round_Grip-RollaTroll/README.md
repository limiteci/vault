# Custom-16 Liberator Round Grip

#### Description

This is the Custom-16 Liberator Round Grip.  The grip is designed to hold .380 ACP rounds. 

#### Instructions
Print and assemble with regular Liberator parts. 

#### Disclaimer 

Even though this grip can carry bullets, you should not assume that the Liberator barrel can handle being fired more than once without replacement.  You may need to replace the barrel in-between shots or use an insert in the barrel for easy extraction.

I have designed this to the best of my abilty, but do not hold me responsible for anything that this is used for or is the result of. I have not actually printed this part, but it should work (I measured everything out). Should be strong enough, but I'm not sure, tell me if it isn't.

Best of luck!
