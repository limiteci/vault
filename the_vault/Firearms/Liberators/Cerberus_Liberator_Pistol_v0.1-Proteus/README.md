#### Instructions 

Print all standard Liberator parts except frame and barrel. Print as many Cerberus barrels as you want and solvent weld them together with MEK as shown in the assembly file.
Slide the barrels from the bottom. Make sure the notch lines up, it is meant to prevent the barrel assembly from going back the wrong way.
To operate, align first barrel, fire, push the next barrel up just past the notch. When it clicks, fire again and continue for however many barrels you used.

#### Disclaimer
The chamber under the trigger guard is meant for a piece of steel in order to comply with the UFA, if in the U.S. If elsewhere, assemble at your own risk.
