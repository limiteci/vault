#### Instructions
1. Print all basic Liberator v1.1 parts except grip, frame and barrel. Assemble parts as usual. Epoxy steel into frame.

2. Print all four barrel parts, all seven PRCs, two chamber lids, and three stock parts of your choice. Use MEK (Methyl Ethyl Ketone) to attach the three stock parts, the four barrel parts, and the chambers/chamber lids. Chambers MUST be airtight, except for the opening to the barrel.

3. Load .380 ACP into back of barrel. Press the barrel into the frame as usual, making sure that the PRCs are sealed from the outside and the barrel is connected properly. 

4. Fire! 

#### Pressure Relief Chambers Note
These chambers are meant to reduce the pressures in the barrel, making it more safe and increasing the life of the barrel. Chambers are slid onto the barrel, then welded on with MEK. 
They MUST be closed to the outside, except through the holes in the barrel. Credit to garcad for concept.

#### Disclaimer
There is no guarantee that this will not explode. Fire it by pulling the trigger with a string a a distance the first time, and only fire it by hand if you are confident it will not explode.
The PRCs are UNTESTED. They need to be tested before they can be confirmed to work. Don't blow up your hand.
