# Pepperbox Liberator


#### Version
1.1

#### Modification List:

* Removal of steel block box. This will have to be re-added if anyone is actually considering printing this
* Barrel is now a 4 chamber, revolving pepperbox cylinder. Chambers .380, and all specs are the same as the liberator barrel internals
* Trigger extended to act as a locking pin to hold cylinder in place during firing. Pull back half way, the gun fires. Pull back all the way, the cylinder can rotate freely
* Frame heavily modified
* Rod added for cylinder retention
* All other parts remain the same. 

#### Author's Notes
* I wanted to do this instead of a semi-auto due to the fact that you have 4 barrels in one. So you can fire the gun 4x more.  In render_5.png, the barrel profile, should be thicker than needed. In fact, the Liberator barrel is weaker than this! I did not intend for it to be used. I'm sure there is going to be a newer generation of 3d printed firearms and this is pretty 1800's. Regardless, if someone wants to print it I'm happy to provide the STL (and SLDPRT) files. 

* If someone does print this, the grip needs to be permanently attached to be legal. Epoxy it. 
* For version 1.1: The cylinder pin holds itself but turning. Additionally, contoured some edges and the new big grip are added.

#### Todos
* I think we should scrap the main barrel till the main mechanism is working. Then we can shorten the cylinder and design a forcing cone and such. If you guys work all that out, I'll make it double action for fun. We will need to beef up the trigger a ton, but the double action would rock.

* Plastic mainspring in the handle is a good idea, but I'm not sure how to make a strong vertical spring. If you design the spring, I'll integrate it. That would eliminate the two circular springs in the frame. 

* Testing, printing and working out any issues. 

#### WARNING
Print at your own RISK!  This is an untested concept that has yet to be printed and fired.  The purpose of this release is so that developers and hobbyist can add to the concept, make improvements, and test safely. If you dont know how to be safe, dont do it.  Becareful and dont be stupid.
