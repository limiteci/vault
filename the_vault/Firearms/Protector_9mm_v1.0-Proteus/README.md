#### ASSEMBLY
Remove supports from parts. First, insert the Glock barrel into the slots in the front of the receiver. Slot the retainer around the barrel,
Making sure it stays down and does not move. Use MEK to secure the barrel by using it on the retainer. Unfortunately this means that
the barrel cannot be removed without breaking the receiver, but you should not have to remove as the receiver will crack long before
the steel barrel breaks. Add FCG at this point through the back of the receiver.
Give both bolt pieces an Acetone Vapor treatment. Next, take bolt_1 and insert the AR-15 firing pin 
in the back. Make sure it slides well and extends far enough out the front. MEK bolt_2 onto the back of bolt_1. 
Add lead weights to the holes on both the guide rail that extends into the buffer tube and to the hole in the front.
NOTE that these weights need fill the hole AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. The bolt much weigh 1.7lb when finished. If the holes are filled correctly you will hit this weight.
Insert the finished bolt into the back of the receiver. Make sure it slides correctly and does not jam. Be sure the ejection port is clear.
Take the small handle and MEK it onto the bolt with in the receiver. Make sure that the mek does not weld the handle OR bolt to the receiver. This is very important.
Assemble magazine by adding follower, spring, and then pushing the plate on. Make sure the magplate stays on and does NOT slide.
Add 9mm ammunition, you should be able to fit about 10. Insert magazine into receiver, the side lever should click into place and secure the magazine.
Release by pressing the lever until it falls. 
Wait 24 hours or more for all MEKed parts to dry completely. 
Add the buffer spring into the buffer tube. Put the pin into the hole to secure. The buffer tube should not rotate due to the square holders.
Make sure everything is working properly. This gun is DIRECT BLOWBACK, so once you load there is no way to remove until you fire.
Pull handle back and release. It should load a round. Pull trigger to fire. After each shot the weapon should cycle to the next round and eject the spent case.

#### SAFETY
The bolt weight ***MUST*** be 1.7LB. If it is NOT 1.7LB, DO NOT FIRE. You will risk an explosion. For the first shots, fire away from you using a string tied to the trigger. 

#### AMERICAN LEGALITY
In CA, this weapon is illegal due to ZIPGUN laws and the ban of pistols with magazines in the front. In NY, this weapon is illegal due to 10 round magazine. Other states *may* have a ban on this weapon if it is considered an AR-15 due to using the FCG. Please verify with ATF.
