# Double Barrel Derringer 


#### Description

This is the Double Barrel Derringer by PaulNoiseLess.  Based on a model (STL) posted at GrabCAD (now it’s gone, of course), fully converted to 3D (no meshes) and redesigned to host a double barrel. Still have to work on some minor details. All parts are designed to minimize the need of supports when printing. It’s intended to work for .22 Short, GyroJets and/or .22 Blanks with pellet capsules. 

The pellets cartridge are not sourced but built out: The case is a simple 3D printed part, the pellets can be easily found or just taken out from a shotgun shell. The sealing is a plastic/paper cover with 2 or 3 spots of wax. In a small cartridge you can host 70/80 pellets and still keep the whole cartridge under 5 grams. (0.175 ounces). That weight is enough for a muzzle speed in between 100 and 250 fps depending on blank load. The blanks can be made using standard .22 cartridges and crimping the case or just inserting some thin paper inside and use wax to seal. Finally, using bigger pellets you can wire them in chunks of 3 or 4 and you’ll enjoy a more controlled expansion at longer distances. Simple. For the SS inserts you can either turn in a Lathe or tune up the barrel to fit any bushing close you can find in a hardware store and just drill the chamber using a 15/64 drill bit. Since the rim recess is located at the extractor, should be ok. 

Firing Pin is not included. You just have to insert a small nail or screw in the hammers. Enjoy.
