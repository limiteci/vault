# .22 COMPACT PISTOL 

#### Description 
This is designed to be a small, simple, compact .22 firearm. It’s size makes it easy to assemble, but the size of the barrel would make this the world’s least accurate pistol

#### Disclaimer

I HAVE NOT printed this. I HAVE NOT tested this. It IS likely to blow up in your hand if you choose to use it, ABSOLUTELY NO testing has been done.

Print at your own risk. Always check ATF restrictions before printing. Also be aware of the Undetectable Firearms Act which possibly makes this firearm illegal. Again, use at own risk.

#### Instructions
One side of the gun has an opening which is large enough to slide a .22 LR cartridge into the back of the barrel. Behind the barrel and chamber there is a long tube-shaped object. This is for the spring and firing pin. The sprint goes in the back end and the firing pin goes in between it and the bullet. Simply pull back the firing pin and holder against the spring, and release. The firing pin is included in the file off to the side of the actual gun.

If the plastic firing pin fails to fire the round, it can be cut out and replaced with a metal pin. This would not only increase the chances of a successful shot, but would also (possibly, don’t quote me and you should probably talk to someone who knows more about it than me), perhaps, make the firearm legal under the Undetectable Firearms Act, as there is now a metal component.
