#### Description

The goal of this project was to make a small parlor pistol. As always, I aim to avoid rafting and support. This parlor pistol is inspired by http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:212279 which is a toy dart pistol of my design. 

You can see a demonstration here: http://youtu.be/l3LeLbWkE0o of the toy pistol. 

Trigger is not a classic trigger where the user pulls back, instead, you push your finger forward to fire the gun.   

To load the gun, pull back the bolt, hold, and then push the trigger upwards towards the receiver. Next load projectile, and fire as stated above.   

Material used: ABS (but PLA may work, just not for barrel!)  

Print all parts at 100% infil, 1 or 2 shells, depending on preference. 2 recommended. No rafting or support needed. All parts are correctly oriented for printing.


#### Assemble  

To assemble, screw the screw into the bolt. Insert bolt into receiver, push to front. Insert spring. Insert 50mm screw from top, and push through. Next attach the grip to the receiver. Push 50mm screw all the way through the grip, and cap with M3 nut. Next add the trigger to the front of the gun, and hold, add muzzle. Finally put a 25mm screw through the front hole, cap with nut.


####Load and Fire 

This gun is not safe. I'm not responsible for you getting hurt. There is no safety. I am not going to add a safety. No safety is implied. 

Pull back bolt, push up trigger. Remove barrel. Insert .177 pellet in barrel. Add 409 shotgun primer on top, pushing .177 pellet into barrel. Push barrel into muzzle (now I regret naming this muzzle...). Twist 90 degrees. Aim, fire.
