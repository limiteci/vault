# Reprringer 6mm

#### Author

#### Version

#### Description
Printable on any Reprap printer. 6mm barrel.

#### Note
You still need some spring, so it isn't 100% printable. Recommand to print mechanical parts from PLA, barrel from ABS and insert some steel tube, if you want to shoot with this. I have made a small change in trigger for better function.

#### Disclaimer
The Reprringer has been tested with blanks but not with real bullets.  Print at your own risk and dont be stupid.
