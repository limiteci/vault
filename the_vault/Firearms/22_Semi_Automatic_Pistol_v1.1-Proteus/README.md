# Semiautomatic (Rimfire) Printable Firearm in .22 LR

#### Version

1.1

#### Tested

NO

#### Descriptions  

These files contain the design for a 3D printed .22 LR Semiautomatic firearm, meant to be used as a handgun. This design uses a modified 10/22
magazine, HOWEVER, it must be printed and the resulting magazine will NOT work in a 10/22 rifle.

##### Features
* Rifled Barrel for ATF compliance
* Metal insert for case extraction
* Easy to use magazine release/catch
* Sectioned receiver, can be printed on printers with 6x6x6" total build area
* Can accept either a 10 or 30 round magazine
* Almost entirely polymer, lightweight

#### Instructions

Print out all parts included except the firing pin and AR-15 FCG simulations. The receiver must be in a material that can be
fused, preferably using MEK. MEK works well on ABS plastic so this is reccomended. Do not use PLA for anything, unless you are an
Australian police force.

##### Obtain the following metal parts
* AR-15 FCG (These may be possible to print in the future)
* 1x8mm Metal insert (This is the same as the insert used in the Reprringer v2.0 pistol and is use for extraction)
* Ruger 10/22 Magazine spring
* AR-15 Buffer Spring
* AR-15 Firing Pin
* 8 245gr .44 bullets (These are used to bring the bolt weight up to the required 0.4 lbs)

Other than the FCG, all of these MUST be metal for a semiautomatic design to function. The FCG is currently not suited for printing.

Assemble as shown in the assembly. If you had to print the receiver in parts, use MEK to combine them. The buffer spring must be glued to
the receiver and bolt. The .44 bullets need to be secured using something such as epoxy.

You will also want to either print or purchase an AR-15 pistol grip.

#### Disclaimer

The creator of this weapon is not responsible for any injuries or legal problems that arise from creating and firing this design.
You, the manufacturer, take responsibility for any issues that may come. Take precautions when firing (Fire with a string for first
shots) and be sure to follow all local firearms laws. 

#### Legality

This weapon is NOT legal to print in California, unless you are an FFL or an FFL modifies this design (Zip Gun Law). The 30 round magazine
may not be legal in your area. This weapon is NOT legal to print in NYC, as weapons made on 3D printers are prohibited. If you
are in the U.S., the Undetectable Firearms Act may apply, in which case you will need to epoxy 3.7 oz of steel into the receiver.
Even if your area is not listed here, be aware of your local laws.
