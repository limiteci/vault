#### Description

Have you ever been out hunting with your rifle and thought I just have to go skinny dipping RIGHT NOW! Then while cooling of in the creek saw a buck poke it's head through the brush...  As you scrambled for your tacticool rifle a sudden feeling of dread struck you as you thought, "Where is my theme MUZAK?!?!"  I know we have all been through this, and it is no fun.

Well, my naked hunting friend you can have no fear. With this mount you can attach your trusty Ipod Nano 4G to your tacticool weapon. This way, even while streaming water from your nude dip in the creek you can still have theme MUZAK as you hurriedly line up the sights for your amazing shot!  Just imagine the comfort you will feel as you know that you can have theme MUZAK for your own memories as you exagerate about how you almost shot that buck while naked!!
