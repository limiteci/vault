#### Description

Picture this. You're walking through the woods after the society you've come to know and love has ended. You only had time to grab your rifle and throw a few magazines into the pocket of your cargo pants. Don't pretend you're not wearing cargo pants right now, I know you are. Suddenly the Fifth Mongolian Horde is coming over the plains. All that stands between them and the Orphanage is you and your rifle. Thirty rounds go down range in seconds. What's this? You forgot to unbutton your cargo pocket. Sloppy, very sloppy. You should be ashamed. As you fumble with those stupid buttons, you are over run by the dirty Mongolians. The last thing you see is orphans running about on fire, blaming you for not being able to reload fast enough. If only you had been able to hang your magazines on your High Speed Low Drag Operator Extraordinaire belt.

NOW YOU CAN!

Look at these magazine clips. LOOK AT THEM. In the renders, the Blue Clips are Left Hand, the Red are Right hand. Now I want you to figure out which hand you use to shoot. Choose the file that says RH for right handed, or LH for Left Handed (you freak). You've got three options for attachment to the base of your magazines. The Bolted_Clamp requires a nut and bolt to go through the tab/hole at the gap. Rubber_Band_Clamp has a groove around the clamp into which you're going to place a couple strong rubber bands. Filament_Clamp has three holes for 1.75 mm filament. You're doing to put a bit of Acetone, ABS Cement (Weld-On #3 is recommended) or Super Glue down both sets of holes (the ones that go all the way through, and the ones that don't), and then quickly shove a section of 1.75mm filament down into the holes. As the Cement cures, it will bind the clamp together. It is HIGHLY recommended that you put positive pressure on the sides to make sure the clamp is as tight as it can be.

It is highly recommended to place the clamp as close to the base as you can so that the baseplate of the magazine prevents deformation of the magazine body (in case you over-tighten). Once the clamps are in place, they should be secure enough for use. For further security, place some acetone or cement on the inside surfaces of the clamp so that it binds to the surface texture of your GI Magazine.

Printing these should be rather stress-free. They're already oriented. ABS is recommended for all three versions. If Nylon is used, Filament_Clamp will not work, but will be just fine for the other two. PLA is not recommended due to its lack of flexibility and brittleness.

These clamps are configured for 1.5" belts or Molle webbing.
