# AUDITOR WRIST GUN 

#### Description
A wrist mounted blank firing gun made for a single .22 blank (made from a .22 LR case). It is simply a cylindrical body with a spring released latch that fires a round/blank charge from a replaceable/disposable barrel. The original use of this device intended to be for a never made “Assassin’s Creed” fan film, but it may be useful to anyone else interested in this gadget. However, I can imagine the design being modified for a Nerf or airsoft novelty gun.

The Auditor is much more useful than as a prop rather than weapon. Just be careful with blanks, as even they can be dangerous at close range. If you build this, please read this: http://defcad.org/forum/index.php?topic=291.0

#### Disclaimer
Manufacture of firearms in many circumstances is illegal. Use of this system requires a spring to work, and the parts to be glued or taped together.
