# DD Liberator 4 Barrel Holder 

### Description 
A device to hold four DD Liberator barrels for easy and quick access. They are slotted into each circular opening so that the rim is on top. When you need to reload the gun, just pull out a new barrel. I have not printed this, yet, if you do please let me know how it goes in the comment section.
