# VZ-58 FRONT SIGHT

#### Description 
It is a front sight base for VZ.58 rifle, which mounts on the barrel and holds the sight itself plus has the bayonet lug.

Measures should be accurate, since they are taken from the real thing. The depth of plunger pin hole is the only guestimate so far, hard to determine without taking the real weapon apart.  I draw it as a learning experience â€“ complex shapes, different methods, a tad of reverse engineering etc.
