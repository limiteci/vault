# .22 TUBE MAGAZINE LOADER 

#### Description 
This is a speed loader for tubular magazine .22 LR rifles such as Marlin and Henry. It will hold 9 magazine fills. 

#### Instructions
There is some glueing required with super glue. To build the body, 2 of the bodyend.stl, and 2 of the body.stl files will need to be printed. The bodyend.stl file has the ability to accept standard swivel sling connections. A spring is needed to connect the top and the bottom caps together. The tip also needs to be super glued to the top. Each tube should be filed smooth to allow each round to flow smoothly. The smaller tubes are for inserting pieces of 3mm filament for use as guide pins.
