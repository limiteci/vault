#### Description
Have you ever wanted to attach your phone to your assault weapon? What about a small tablet? Perhaps you have an old pocket pc, or even a nintendo DS!  With this little mount it doesn't matter, mount whatever hand held device you wish to your black rifle!  Be tacticool in the extreme!

Seriously...

This two piece unit is designed to allow a person to attach a handheld device to a picatinny rail for use in telemetry or just because you can. At the moment it only has the socket and the rail base mount. By attaching or integrating the socket into a case or device you can attach almost any device you want to your black rifle.  This includes, phones, ipods, handheld gaming devices, or *whatever else you can think of.  *weight dependent

If the device is too large for a central mount on it's case, just place one edge against the rail base and it should hold steady. Once the design has been printed and tested we can refine it further.
