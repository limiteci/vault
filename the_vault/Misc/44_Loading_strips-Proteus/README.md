#.44 Revolver loading strips 

###Description
Loading strips for a .44 magnum revolver. These are meant to allow you to quickly load your revolver without use of a+ speedloader. I have not tested yet, but I suggest printing in a flexible material such as Flex PLA or Taulmans 618. ABS or ordinary PLA will most likely not work on this model. Print bottom down for best results. I was not able to get the exact dimensions between the chambers in the cylinder, so you may not be able to load two rounds at once as an ordinary one would allow. However, you can do one at a time and it will still be faster than if you do it by hand. Enjoy!
