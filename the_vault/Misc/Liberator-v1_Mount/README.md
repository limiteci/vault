# Liberator Pistol Mount

### Description 
This is a device to mount a Liberator Pistol for test firing. The two holes are for screws to attach to the body of the gun, and the bottom can be attached to something else, such as a wooden post. This is meant to test fire your gun remotely with a string before you actually fire it by hand, to make sure it doesn't explode.
