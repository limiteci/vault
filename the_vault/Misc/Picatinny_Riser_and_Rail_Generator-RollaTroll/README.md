#### Author

#### Description

Got Rails? This is a solidworks file, and some STEP and STL examples, that can be used to generate the picatinny rail of your dreams. Examples provided are in 15, 20 and 25mm height, and 4, 6, 8 and 10 tooth lengths, with no extra.  The basic rail has been exported in a 50 tooth length, which if necessary, may be cut to size in CAD. However, it is recommended that the file is re-exported at the required length.

#### Instructions

* To configure parameters, go to *File Properties* -> *Custom* 
* After changing values, select *OK* and force rebuild with *Ctrl* + *Q*
* Without modification to the riser feature structure,  
* 'Height' must be >= 13.25mm, however, >=15 is highly recommended  
* 'Number of Teeth' must be >= 4  
* 'Extra Front' and 'Extra Rear' must be >= 0
* Hardware: Nuts and bolts used are two M5's, maybe 28mm long, and two matching nuts.
