# VOLTLOCK ELECTRONIC BLACK POWDER SYSTEM

#### Description
The Voltlock is a family of black powder designs utilizing electronic ignition. You print the barrel, work on the electronics, and put in the powder and projectile (or blank) before firing.

Each “firearm” is a barrel with a muzzle and touchhole. You put a wire loop in the touchhole, in contact with the black powder. Tungsten wire loops like used in model rockets or spark plugs might work, and then dip them in cooking or veggie oil. Wire them to a 9 V battery and have a “trigger” that completes the circuit using the wire. The oil should ignite the powder and send your projectile out. Be warned this system is mostly intended for SMALL loads of black powder. The caliber of each barrel (in millimeters) is in the name. Various inventors, scientists, and engineers are the namesakes for each barrel. Also included is a ‘husk’ file able to be fitted to any caliber (up to 12.7mm) I did not include.
