#### Description
Basically a bumpfire stock, but more fun, and probably more controlable. 

And also technically not a stock, so attach it to a 7" upper. Go crazy. 


#### Instructions

##### Bill of Materials:
*  4x 1/4-20 nuts 
*  1/4-20 threaded rod about 10" long
*  2x 'hand' 
*  2x 'top' 
*  1x 'pull'
*  1x 'push'
*  1x 'finger'
*  1x 'grip'

The 'push' file was designed to be a slip fit over a milspec buffer. If you have a commercial one, stop buying Anderson. The assembly is pretty self explanatory, rod and related holes are on the passenger (right) side of the rifle. Push goes on the end of your buffer tube, the 'top' pieces go into the top and bottom of the 'pull' piece, connected with the 'hand' pieces to form the grip.

The grip piece goes in place of the pistol grip, and guides the rod to the 'finger' piece which actually does the trigger pulling. 

*THIS IS CONNECTED DIRECTLY TO THE TRIGGER.*

*UNLOAD **AND** MAKE SAFE BEFORE MOVING OR YOU **WILL** HURT YOURSELF.*


Licensed under the GPL, no commercial sales, no stealing (cough FOSTECH cough).

Load up, point at target, and push on buffer, you'll get the hang of it after the first burst.
