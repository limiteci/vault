#  Triple Shotshell Carrier 


#### Description
Front and back halves for a quick-access 3x 12-gauge shotshell holder.

The holder is open on the sides and front so the shells can be easily lifted out, but will (should!) not fall out on their own.

It’s faster than typical bandoliers or reaching into a pocket of loose shells. Useful for shooting matches or competitions like 3-gun – which are timed.

This was inspired by some much nicer and higher-capacity off-the-shelf designs. Why spend $$$ on a commercial unit when you can spend hours to make your own much smaller, much crappier version?
